Numerous scientific contributions have highlighted the great environmental challenges posed by food, diets and nutrition, exacerbated by the rapid growth of the global population. The meat and dairy industry currently occupy 83% of the total agricultural land and produce 60% of the global agricultural sector's greenhouse gas emissions, inducing land use change and degradation, loss of biodiversity, and consumption of water and energy. In most countries of the world, meat consumption has grown steadily in the twentieth century. Only in Africa has consumption remained almost stationary. In the coming decades, the strong economic development of sub-Saharan Africa could therefore significantly increase the demand for meat in the continent, and therefore require significant energy inputs and strongly influence the use of soils and emissive trajectories. Through the use of econometric tools, scenarios development, and environmentally-extended input-output modelling, the project aims to estimate the implications of these trends for human, energy, and environmental systems.

This repository contains the code and the data to replicate the analysis of the paper 'Environmental and energy implications of meat consumption pathways in sub-Saharan Africa' by Giacomo Falchetta, Nicol√≤ Golinucci, Michel Noussan and Matteo Vincenzo Rocco.
